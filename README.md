#DESCRIPTION:A recommendation system is a software application that suggests products, services, or content to users based on their preferences or past interactions. These systems are widely used in e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social media to enhance user experience and engagement.This Java-based recommendation system demonstrates how to build a machine learning-powered product recommender using Apache Mahout. We explored setting up the project, handling data, implementing collaborative filtering, and generating personalized recommendations. By fine-tuning data, algorithms, and similarity models, we can improve accuracy and create a real-world 
e-commerce recommendation system.
Apache Mahout (for collaborative filtering and similarity computations)
Maven (For managing dependencies like Apache Mahout)
